# Recommender-System
A Recommender system is an UnSupervised Machine Learning Solution which, typically produce a list of recommendations through collaborative filtering or through content-based filtering


Recommender system
A recommendation system is basically an information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. It is widely used in different internet / online business such as e-commerce or social media. By using recommender systems, those companies are able to provide better or more suited products/services/contents that are personalized to a user based on user's past or behaviors.


At some point each one of us must have wondered where all the recommendations that Netflix, Amazon, Google give us, come from. We often rate products on the internet and all the preferences we express and data we share (explicitly or not), are used by recommender systems to generate, these personalized, recommendations. The two main types of recommender systems are :-

						1] Content-Based Filters
						2] Collaborative Filters (Item based / User based)
						3] Hybrid (Combination of above two)
 
 I will use movies as an example (because if I could, I would be watching movies/tv shows all the time), but keep in mind that this type of process can be applied for any kind of product you watch, listen to, buy, and so on.
